Given an integer, n, perform the following conditional actions:
If n is odd, print Weird
If n is even and in the inclusive range of 2 to 5, print Not Weird
If n is even and in the inclusive range of 6 to 20, print Weird
If n is even and greater than 20, print Not Weird

Task 
The provided code stub reads two integers from STDIN, a and b. Add code to print three lines where:
The first line contains the sum of the two numbers.
The second line contains the difference of the two numbers (first - second).
The third line contains the product of the two numbers.

    print(a+b)
    print(a-b)
    print(a*b)

# Python: Division
'''
Task 
The provided code stub reads two integers, a and b, from STDIN.
Add logic to print two lines. The first line should contain the result of integer division,  a// b. 
The second line should contain the result of float division,  a/b .
No rounding or formatting is necessary.

a = int(input())
b = int(input())

print(int(a/b))
print(a/b)

# Loops
'''
Task 
The provided code stub reads and integer, n, from STDIN. For all non-negative integers i < n, print i^2.
'''
count = 0
for i in range(1,n+1):
    print(count**2)
    count += 1
